# Personal-Website
To run the website locally:
1. Download the single 'Application' folder and open a terminal in the folder
2. Install flask with 'pip install flask' when python is setup correctly as an environment variable. Go to https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/ for full instructions
3. In the same terminal, enter 'flask --app backend run' and go to where it is said to be running locally

Yay! You can successfully look at my personal website (still being worked on), I will hopefully deploy soon enough!
